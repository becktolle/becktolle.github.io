Let's start by loading it in and looking at the structure of the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nouter_space_objects\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1,175 × 4\n   Entity  Code   Year num_objects\n   <chr>   <chr> <dbl>       <dbl>\n 1 APSCO   <NA>   2023           1\n 2 Algeria DZA    2002           1\n 3 Algeria DZA    2010           1\n 4 Algeria DZA    2016           3\n 5 Algeria DZA    2017           1\n 6 Angola  AGO    2017           1\n 7 Angola  AGO    2022           1\n 8 Arabsat <NA>   1985           2\n 9 Arabsat <NA>   1992           1\n10 Arabsat <NA>   1996           2\n# ℹ 1,165 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt looks like that the dataset is composed of 4 variables and 1175 observations. \n\n  1. `Entity`: Entity, country or other entity\n  2. `Code`: Entity code\n  3.  `Year`\n  4. `num_objects`: Annual number of objects launched into outer space\n  \n`Code` seems mostly useless for our purposes, and `Entity` could use some cleaning up, like separating country and other entities to different categories.\n  \n# Initial Clean Up\n\nTo start I'm going to separate the `Entity` into countries and other entities, and I'm going to remove the `Code` column. \n<br>\nLooking through the data it appears that the non-country entities are:\n\n1. `APSCO`: The Asia Pacific Space Cooperation Organisation.\n2. `Arabsat`: The Arab Satellite Communications Organization.\n3. `EUMETSAT`: the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites.\n4. `European Space Agency`\n5. `European Union`\n6. `Eutelsat`: A French Satellite Operator.\n7. `Inmarsat`: A British Satellite Operator.\n8. `Intelsat`: A Multinational Satellite Operator.\n9. `Intersputnik`: Intersputnik International Organization of Space Communications.\n10. `NATO`\n11. `RASCOM`: Regional African Satellite Communication Organization\n12. `Sea Launch`: Multinational Launch Company (defunct).\n13. `Starsem`: Russian company made for the Souyez launch. \n14. `World`: World data set.\n\nLooks like you can categorize these into multinational and private organizations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nouter_space_objects$Organization <- \"Country\"\nouter_space_objects %>% arrange(Code)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1,175 × 5\n   Entity               Code   Year num_objects Organization\n   <chr>                <chr> <dbl>       <dbl> <chr>       \n 1 Angola               AGO    2017           1 Country     \n 2 Angola               AGO    2022           1 Country     \n 3 United Arab Emirates ARE    2000           1 Country     \n 4 United Arab Emirates ARE    2003           1 Country     \n 5 United Arab Emirates ARE    2008           1 Country     \n 6 United Arab Emirates ARE    2009           1 Country     \n 7 United Arab Emirates ARE    2011           1 Country     \n 8 United Arab Emirates ARE    2012           1 Country     \n 9 United Arab Emirates ARE    2013           1 Country     \n10 United Arab Emirates ARE    2017           1 Country     \n# ℹ 1,165 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nouter_space_objects$Organization[c(1, 8:18, 222:232, 246:290, 512, 700:704, 764, 765, 1108:1174)] <- \"Multinational\"\nouter_space_objects$Organization[c(291:311, 469:511, 843, 904)] <- \"Private\"\nouter_space_objects <- outer_space_objects %>%\n  select(-Code)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# General Observations\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Project2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nThe amount of objects launched into space have only significantly increased in the last 15 years, this is almost certainly due to the internet age.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nouter_space_objects2 <- outer_space_objects %>%\nselect(-Year)%>%\n  group_by(Entity)%>%\n    summarise(across(num_objects, sum))%>%\n  arrange(desc(num_objects))\n```\n:::\n\nI've removed the year column and combined each country data set so we have a flat rate of total objects launched.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 109 × 2\n   Entity                num_objects\n   <chr>                       <dbl>\n 1 World                       17263\n 2 United States                9632\n 3 Russia                       3723\n 4 China                        1051\n 5 United Kingdom                765\n 6 Japan                         325\n 7 France                        151\n 8 India                         144\n 9 Germany                       120\n10 European Space Agency         104\n# ℹ 99 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThe World has the most objects launched into space by far.

I had some perception that this was the case, but I wasn't sure how it was labelled or kept as data, whether it was done by launching location, who worked on it the most or if it was considered a \"group\" effort and each country is mentioned separately.\n",
